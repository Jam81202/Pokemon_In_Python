# Pythmon

*This is just a solo passion project I'm using to get familiar with Python and to have fun. I'm not going to sell this and I might not ever finish it.*

Spin off Pokemon game made with python. It's pretty bad but the first actual project I'm doing in python so I'm okay with that. It's not simply a battle simulator. This is my attempt at recreating a basic version of the main line jrpg games with an overworld map, trainers, wild encounters, items, and an economy.

Planned Features:
  Around 50 or so pokemon,
  75-100 different and unique moves (limited animations),
  7 locations,
  4 gyms,
  Random wild encounters,
  Poke centers and poke marts,
  Economy,
  Overworld party pokemon sprites that follow player,
  25 Trainers along routes to battle,
  PC Storage
  and potentially more
    
In-Progress:
  23 Pokemon,
  43 Moves (no animations),
  Concept map drawn with:
    7 locations, 4 gyms, and 6 routes,
  Wild encouters (Currently working, but encounters aren't random. I wanted to finish the map first. i.e. battling is fully functional),
  Overworld party pokemon sprites that follow player,
  Trainer battles (They work, but I don't have the planned 25 unique trainers yet. I have 3 unique trainers I have been using for testing. The rest will come after map is completed.),
  PC Storage (It works, but I haven't created a UI for it yet. As of right now, it prints to console and you can't retrieve pokemon from it. Only store when you catch a pokemon and your party is full.),
  Items:
    Healing (3), 
    Leveling (5), 
    Battle stat (6),
    Poke Balls (4),
  Pokecenters - Basic function (healing party) is completed and functional, but interior is incomplete only having the nurse to heal your pokemon, 
  
Untouched Features:
  Economy,
  Poke marts (You can use items. I want to complete the map before I start this however),
  Save States (As of now, you cannot save the game and all progress will be lost upon exiting the game)
