# Pkmn-in-python
Spin off Pokemon game made with python. It's pretty bad but the first actual project I'm doing in python so I'm okay with that. It's not simply a battle simulator. This is my attempt at recreating a basic version of the main line rpg games with an overworld map, trainers, wild encounters, items, and an economy.

Planned Features:
  Around 50 or so pokemon,
  75-100 different and unique moves (limited animations),
  4 cities/towns (with gym leaders),
  Random wild encounters,
  Poke centers and poke marts,
  Economy,
  Overworld party pokemon sprites that follow player,
  Trainers along routes to battle,
  and potentially more
  
  Possible Features: 
    PC (pokemon storage system)
